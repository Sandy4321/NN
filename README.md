Most of the programmes within are defunct. The only truly working one is in net, which is at the moment is not user friendly. It works to some degree, but I'm still battling with the hyperparameter settings and debugging. I'll need to add a few most visualisation tools and a a better API, but for now it certainly runs faster than some of the online theano downloads available (courtesy of better GPU RNGs).

Do note that data files have not been included. Any data you do want can be downloaded from the theano website in a gzipped version of a pickle file i.e. ends in .pkl.gz. The one I've focussed on is the MNIST dataset, but there are many more available of course.
