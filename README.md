The programmes within implement various examples of neural networks. Contained are examples of classical feed-forward NNs and RBMs.

The feed-forward neural networks rely on the FANN library --- fast artificial neural network library found at http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/.

The restricted Boltzmann machines are my own.

Data files have not been included. The standard data file format is currently my own obscure flavour of text files, but I'll soon standardise this and add robust notes.
