#Fully marginalised autoencoders
These are a family of machines which can be used for novel initialisation of neural networks. They can be trained extremely fast, they have a unique solution and they have aesthetic theoretical properties.

##TODO
- [x] Correct the bias
- [ ] arbitrary hidden layer size
- [ ] layer size selection
- [ ] kernelisation
- [ ] large data
- [ ] convolutional layers

## Experimetns to perform
- [ ] with and without full marginalisation, retargetting, fine-tuning
- [ ] visualisation
- [ ] nonparametric scoring
- [ ] other datasets, e.g. NORB, CIFAR?
